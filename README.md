Analysis of World Bank Debt Data using SQL

Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals requires significant investments in infrastructure, human capital, and climate change resilience. But governments in developing countries are often limited in their ability to mobilize domestic revenues or private investment.
Debt is a form of financing where one party borrows money from a second party. Debt is used by many corporations and individuals to make large purchases that they could not afford under normal circumstances. A debt arrangement gives the borrowing party permission to borrow money under the condition that it is to be paid back at a later date, usually with interest.
The World Bank Group is working to help countries manage their debt better. They offer technical assistance and guidance to advance a reform agenda that strengthens on a multi-pronged approach to reduce debt vulnerabilities in developing countries. 

In this project we look at debt data from 1970-2015 and use SQL to pull meaningful information from it.
